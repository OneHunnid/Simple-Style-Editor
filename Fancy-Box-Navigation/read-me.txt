//WELCOME

Congrats and thank you for downloading the WebCards Fancy Box Navigation! We hope you enjoy this Squarespace extension and share with other Squarespace developers to spread the love.

// INSTALLATION

To use the Fancy Box Navigation, you’ll need to replace your main-navigation styling with WebCard’s main-navigation styling.  Then you’ll need to add the tweak files to your .less file at the top.  This will switch the main navigation on your site to ours and you will be able to adjust the colors, typography and values by using the Style Editor.

// HOW TO USE

Once the Fancy Box Navigation is installed you will need to login to your Squarespace account.  Once logged in, you will need to hit on Preview Site (eyeball icon) in the top left corner which will bring you to the front of your site.  Then click on the paintbrush icon in the bottom right to launch the style editor.  The Style Editor will slide out from the left and you will be able to modify the typography, colors and values of your main navigation.

//LICENSE 

WebCards Fancy Box Navigation is available for you to use under the MIT license.  Feel free to use this extension as you wish.  It’s also cool to credit WebCards as the original creator.
